phpctags
========

An enhanced php ctags file generator.

Using [PHP_Parse](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser) as PHP syntax parsing
backend, written in pure PHP. The generated ctags index file contains scope
and access information about the class methods and properties.

This tool was originally developed to enhance the PHP surport for
[tagbar](http://majutsushi.github.com/tagbar/) vim plugin. The enhaced
functionality has been included into an addon plugin for tagbar as
[tagbar-phpctags](https://github.com/techlivezheng/tagbar-phpctags).
